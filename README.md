# Mosspedia
A simple project to create a website about mosses, in order to learn more HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

Most information (articles content etc) about moss on the website is AI generated.
Thought it would be better to test it this way instead of using lorem ipsum.
Take it with a grain of salt.
